## Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone application that authenticates users against Azure AD.

## Scenario

1. The ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone app uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain an ID Token from **Azure AD**:
2. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD**.

## Contents

> Give a high-level folder structure of the sample.

| File/folder       | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CHANGELOG.md`    | List of changes to the sample.             |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines for contributing to the sample. |
| `LICENSE`         | The license for the sample.                |

## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your **Azure AD**. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-blazor-wasm.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: Given that the name of the sample is quite long, and so are the names of the referenced packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid maximum file path length limitations on Windows.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the web app (WebApp-blazor-wasm)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-blazor-wasm`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44314/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44314/authentication/login-callback`
   - In the **Logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44314/signout-oidc`.
   - In **Implicit grant** section, select the check box for ID tokens.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

#### Configure the web app (WebApp-blazor-wasm) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `wwwroot\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-blazor-wasm` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Authority` and replace the existing value with 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/'+$tenantId.
1. Find the key `ValidateAuthority` and replace the existing value with 'true'.

    {
        builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options.ProviderOptions.Authentication);
    });
```

## Deployment

### Deployment to Azure App Services

There is one web project in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of the local environment.

#### Create and publish `WebApp-blazor-wasm` to an Azure App Services

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebApp-blazor-wasm-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Next, select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql conenction string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->

1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->


##### Update the Azure AD app registration for `WebApp-blazor-wasm`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `WebApp-blazor-wasm` application.
1. In the **Authentication** page for your application, update the Logout URL fields with the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-blazor-wasm-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-blazor-wasm-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebApp-blazor-wasm-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebApp-blazor-wasm-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will emptied. In addition, if you increase the instance count of your web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
