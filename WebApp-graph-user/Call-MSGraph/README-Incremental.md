## Overview

In the second chapter, we extend our ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone application to call a downstream API (Microsoft Graph) to obtain more information about the signed-in user.

This sample demonstrates an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone application that authenticates users against [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview). It then acquires an Access Token for Microsoft Graph and calls the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview).

## Scenario

With respect to the previous chapter of the tutorial, this chapter adds the following steps:

1. The client application acquires an Access Token for Microsoft Graph.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to call the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview)
1. **Microsoft Graph API** responds with the resource that the user has access to.

## How to run this sample

### In the downloaded folder

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
cd ms-identity-blazor-wasm\WebApp-graph-user\Call-MSGraph
```

### Update the Registration for the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

#### Update Registration for the web app (WebApp-blazor-wasm)

1. In **App registrations** page, find the *WebApp-blazor-wasm* app
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - In **Implicit grant** section, select the check box for Access tokens.
   - Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the web app (WebApp-blazor-wasm)

1. Open `blazorwasm-calls-MS-graph\wwwroot\appsettings.json` file and copy the details from `WebApp-OIDC\blazorwasm-singleOrg\wwwroot\appsettings.json` file.

## Running the sample

You can run the sample by using either Visual Studio or command line interface as shown below:

### Run the sample using Visual Studio

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

### Run the sample using a command line interface such as VS Code integrated terminal

#### Step 1. Install .NET Core dependencies

```console
cd WebApp-graph-user\Call-MSGraph
cd blazorwasm-calls-MS-graph
dotnet restore
```

#### Step 2. Trust development certificates

```console
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Learn more about [HTTPS in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).

#### Step 3. Run the applications

In the console window execute the below command:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

> If you are using incognito mode of browser to run this sample then allow third party cookies.

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:44314`.
1. Select the **Sign in** button on the top right corner. You will see claims from the signed-in user's token.

1. Select **Profile** from navigation bar on the left. If user has signed-in then information fetched from Microsoft Graph is displayed, otherwise login screen will appear.

## About the code

For details about the code to enable your Blazor Single-page Application (SPA) to sign-in users, see [About the code](../../WebApp-OIDC/MyOrg/README.md#about-the-code) section, of the README.md file located at **WebApp-OIDC/MyOrg**.

This section, here, is only about the additional code added to let the Web App call the Microsoft Graph.

1. In Program.cs, register the Microsoft Graph Client as a scoped service using an extension method:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddGraphClient(builder.Configuration);
    ```

    **AddGraphClient** is an extension method is defined in `GraphClientExtensions.cs`.
    > be sure to copy this file into your project if you are _not_ running executing this sample project directly.

    This implementation relies on the following configuration in `appsettings.json`.

    ```json
    "MicrosoftGraph": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0",
      "Scopes": [
        "user.read"
      ]
    }
    ```

1. **UserProfile.razor** component displays user information retrieved by **GetUserProfile** method of **UserProfileBase.cs**.

    **UserProfileBase.cs** calls Microsoft Graph `/me` endpoint to retrieve user information.

    ```csharp
    public class UserProfileBase : ComponentBase
    {
        [Inject]
        GraphServiceClient GraphClient { get; set; }
        protected User _user = new User();
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            await GetUserProfile();
        }
        private async Task GetUserProfile()
        {
            ...
                var request = GraphClient.Me;
                _user = await request.GetAsync();
            ...
        }
    }
    ```
