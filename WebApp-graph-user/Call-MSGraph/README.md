## Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly Web App calling Microsoft Graph.

> :information_source: To learn how applications integrate with [Microsoft Graph](https://aka.ms/graph), consider going through the recorded session:: [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A)

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly Web App uses the  to authenticate a user and obtain a JWT [ID Token](https://aka.ms/id-tokens) and an [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
1. The **access token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to call the Microsoft Graph protected by **Azure AD**.

![Scenario Image](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

* Install [\.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet).
* Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
* An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/test-setup-environment#get-a-test-tenant)
* A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.

>This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. If you're signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal Microsoft account and have not created a user account in your directory before, you will need to create one before proceeding.

## Setup the sample

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-blazor-wasm.git
```

or download and extract the repository *.zip* file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Navigate to project folder

```console
cd WebApp-graph-user/Call-MSGraph/blazorwasm-calls-MS-graph
```

### Step 3: Register the sample application(s) in your tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

    > :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
  
    1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
    1. In PowerShell run:

       ```PowerShell
       Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
       ```

    1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
    1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

       ```PowerShell
       cd .\AppCreationScripts\
       .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
       ```

    > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.
    
    
</details>

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

To manually register the apps, as a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the webApp app (WebApp-blazor-wasm)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-blazor-wasm`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Single-page application** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URI:
        1. `https://localhost:44314/authentication/login-callback`
    1. In the **Front-channel logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44314/signout-oidc`.
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is is required by apps signing-in users.
    1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs:
    1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
    1. Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
    1. In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
    1. In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    1. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

##### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select **optional claim type**, then choose **ID**.
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

##### Configure the webApp app (WebApp-blazor-wasm) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `blazorwasm-calls-MS-graph\wwwroot\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_Application_ID_here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `WebApp-blazor-wasm` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_Tenant_ID_here` and replace the existing value with 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/'+$tenantId.

### Step 4: Running the sample

From your shell or command line, execute the following commands:

```console
    cd WebApp-graph-user/Call-MSGraph/blazorwasm-calls-MS-graph
    dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

> If you are using incognito mode of browser to run this sample then allow third party cookies.

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:44314`.
1. Select the **Sign in** button on the top right corner. You will see claims from the signed-in user's token.

    ![UserClaims](./ReadmeFiles/UserClaims.png)

1. Select **Profile** from navigation bar on the left. If user has signed-in then information fetched from Microsoft Graph is displayed, otherwise login screen will appear.

## About the code

1. In Program.cs, Main method registers **AddMsalAuthentication** as explained below:

   ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>
    {
        builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options.ProviderOptions.Authentication);
    });
   ```

   **AddMsalAuthentication** is an extension method provided by the [Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Authentication.WebAssembly.Msal) package and it provides support for authenticating users with the Microsoft Identity Platform.

1. **Index.razor** is the landing page when application starts. Index.razor contains child component called `UserClaims`. If user is authenticated successfully, `UserClaims` displays a few claims present in the ID Token issued by Azure AD.

1. In the `UserClaimsBase.cs` class, **GetClaimsPrincipalData** method retrieves signed-in user's claims using the **GetAuthenticationStateAsync()** method of the **AuthenticationStateProvider** class.

   ```csharp
    public class UserClaimsBase: ComponentBase
    {
        [Inject]
        private AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider { get; set;
        }
        protected string _authMessage;
        protected IEnumerable<Claim> _claims = Enumerable.Empty<Claim>();
        private string[] returnClaims = { "name", "preferred_username", "tid", "oid" };
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            await GetClaimsPrincipalData();
        }
        private async Task GetClaimsPrincipalData()
        {
            var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
            var user = authState.User;

            if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                _authMessage = $"{user.Identity.Name} is authenticated.";
                _claims = user.Claims.Where(x => returnClaims.Contains(x.Type));
            }
            else
            {
                _authMessage = "The user is NOT authenticated.";
            }
        }
    }
   ```

1. In Program.cs, Main method registers AddMicrosoftGraphClient as explained below:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddMicrosoftGraphClient("https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read");
    ```

    **AddMsalAuthentication** is an extension method provided by GraphClientExtensions.cs class.

1. **UserProfile.razor** component displays user information retrieved by **GetUserProfile** method of **UserProfileBase.cs**.

    **UserProfileBase.cs** calls Microsoft Graph `/me` endpoint to retrieve user information.

    ```csharp
    public class UserProfileBase : ComponentBase
    {
        [Inject]
        GraphServiceClient GraphClient { get; set; }
        protected User _user=new User();
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            await GetUserProfile();
        }
        private async Task GetUserProfile()
        {
            ...
                var request = GraphClient.Me.Request();
                _user = await request.GetAsync();
            ...
        }
    }
    ```
